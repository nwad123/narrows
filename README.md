Narrows is a C++ channel library providing efficient and easy-to-use communication channels for concurrent programming. This library was a chance for me to learn more personally about cross thread channels, and you probably want to make sure you consider the tradeoffs I've made before using it for your project.

## Features

- Bounded channel: A channel with a fixed capacity
- Unbounded channel: A channel with no upper bound on its capacity
